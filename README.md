This plugin tracks information about your group ironman player and sends it to a server where you and your other group members can view it. Currently it tracks:

* Inventory, equipment, bank, and shared bank
* Skill XP
* World position, viewable in an interactive map
* HP, prayer, energy, and world as well as showing inactivity
* Quest state - completed, finished, in progress

## Setup
Each group member that you want to track will need to install the plugin. Just one person will go to the site and create a group, the credentials it provides is shared with your group.
